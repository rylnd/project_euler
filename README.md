# Project Euler Solutions #

This is a collection of my first adventures with both Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net) and Python.

I wasn't planning on sharing these when I started writing them, and also didn't know Python, so the formatting and syntax varies pretty widely. 

Most recently I've been defining a problem in its own file, with the general idea that the script contains a function by the same name, and also calls that function. This allows you both execute the code and call the function again in the interpreter if'n you want. 

Again, these are really rough; most don't even have comments, and the earlier ones are very non-pythonic.  Some are (in my opinion) well-documented on my blog; see the repo link above.  Most aren't.  I'm working on it.

## Usage ##
To execute and open an interpreter: 

   python -i p22.py

You should then be able to run the script again by calling [filename]().  Emphasis on _should_.
